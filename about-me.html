              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hello! I am Steven Santana, a Student of Computer Science at CUNY Hunter College.
                <br><br>
                I kind of have a jack of all trades, master of none thing going on. Despite around 4 years learning the intricacies of C++,
                I've picked up all kinds of other things in passing. Languages like Java, Python, R, and Javascript. 
                
                <br><br>
                I am one of the vocalists/songwriters, the bassist, and sometimes guitarist and drummer of a band called Smile Eyes. Been singing since 2017, drumming since 2016, playing bass since
                2010, and guitar since 2007. I also do some audio mixing and mastering, for fun and to further my musical goals. 
                
                <br><br>
                Among other places I've delved into, I spent 2006 to 2009 working as a level designer utilizing the Source Engine's Hammer level 
                editor, most of my work done for a now defunct online roleplaying community. I have also spent time learning and working on 
                level design in Unreal Engine 4 for a now shelved horror game titled "Claustroshock".

                <br><br>
                I spent a good three to four years in tech repair and tech sales simultaneously, until I found myself looking for more challenges
                beyond what I was already well versed in. 

                <br><br>

                As is clear I've seen alot, but nothing had really resonated with me until I found Computer Science and programming.
